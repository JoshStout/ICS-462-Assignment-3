Assignment 3
This program contains a producer and consumer class instances that shares a circular array. The producer class instance thread adds to the array the loop counter value while the consumer class instance thread reads from the array. Each thread reads and writes to the array at different rates, causing them to wait for each other whenever the array is full.
